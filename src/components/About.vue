                    <p class="lead">Isipho is a product of Africa, by Africans. It was a business established to educate the African masses further about their history prior to the 20th century. The founder of Isipho Sakhe Mzolisa identified that there was a vacuum in the history gap of Africa as the current history curriculum in schools does not cover or teach the atrocities committed against Africans during the pre colonial and post colonial occupation of Africa. </p>
                    <p class="lead">We have been taught that the most wicked and vile leaders were the likes of Adolf Hitler, Mussolini due to them killing and ostracizing Europeans. We do not really know much or nothing at all about people such as King Leopold of Belgium, Kabila of the Congo, Idi Amin of Uganda who were also quite vile and rotten as there European counterparts.
                        We exist to teach and sell decolonized historical and Social Science books.
